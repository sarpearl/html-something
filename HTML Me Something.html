				 <img src="https://c.tenor.com/Ca6vBbig1QUAAAAC/reptar-rampage.gif" alt="Reptar" width="400" height="300">
				 <p> Reptar is a fictional dinosaur character (a green Tyrannosaurus Rex) within the American TV series, Rugrats. Tommy and the other babies look up to him. He is a green dinosaur (and sometimes appears in red-violet and lilac) with rounded, blue spike-like appendages on his back, and breath fire, which intentionally causes him to resemble and spoof Godzilla. </p>

				 <img src="https://c.tenor.com/z8wwIGrnX0MAAAAC/tom-servo-mst3k-internet.gif" alt="Tom Servo" width="300" height="300">
				 <p>Tom Servo is a small, red robot created by Gizmonic Institute employee Joel Robinson. Joel created Tom along with Cambot, Gypsy and Crow T. Robot to help stave off boredom and madness while he underwent the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" experiments, wherein The Mads forced Joel to watch poorly-made or otherwise-unenjoyable movies in an effort to drive him insane. Tom is a red puppet that has a gumball machine for a head, a body composed of a toy coin bank and a toy car engine block, and a bowl-shaped hovercraft skirt instead of legs.</p>

				 <h3> Dino Flintstone </h3>
				 <h4> [The Flintstones] </h4>
				 <img src="https://c.tenor.com/6b3ahDvYGXYAAAAC/flintstones-dino.gif" alt="Dino" width="450" height="300">
				 <p> Dino (pronounced dee-no) is a pet Snorkasaurus of the series' main characters, Fred and Wilma Flintstone. In the show, he is a metaphorical pet sauropod dinosaur and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated dog. A recurring gag in the series is Dino gets excited and knocks Fred down (usually when he comes home from work) and licks his face continuously. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. </p>

				 <h3>C-3PO</h3>
				 <h4> [Star Wars]</h4>
				 <img src="https://i.gifer.com/embedded/download/1OYg.gif" alt="C-3PO" width="500" height="225">
				 <p>C-3PO, sometimes spelled See-Threepio and often referred to as Threepio, was a bipedal, humanoid protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for etiquette and protocol. He was fluent in over six million forms of communication, and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. After being destroyed and discarded on the planet Tatooine before 32 BBY, C-3PO was rebuilt; his salvaged nature gave him special qualities that distinguished him from similar droid models. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history, and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions. C-3PO considered various droids and organics to be friends of his, and was very dedicated to them, as well as to any master that he served.</p>

				 <p> Robert Mark "Robbie" Sinclair is a Hypsilophodon and the oldest child in the Sinclair family. Robbie is an average teenager. He's a bit of a rebel, questioning his father's authority and often playing a part in episodes focusing on environmental issues. He is the only member of the Sinclair family to ever wear shoes; the rest of them appear barefoot. </p>

				 <h3>Dot Matrix</h3>
				 <h4> [Spaceballs] </h4>
				 <img src="https://i.gifer.com/IlV6.gif" alt="Dot Matrix" width="500" height="300">
				 <p> Dot Matrix is the "Droid of Honor" for Princess Vespa at her wedding. She is a robot and is the parody of C-3PO from Star Wars. In both Spaceballs and Spaceballs: The Animated Series, she was voiced by Joan Rivers. In the original movie, Lorene Yarnell played the robot, with Rivers dubbing over her lines. </p>

				 <h3>Mononykus</h3>
				 <h4> [Prehistoric Planet] </h4>
				 <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/376/516/927.jpeg" alt="Dot Matrix" width="375" height="250">
				 <p> Mononykus (meaning "one claw") was a theropod dinosaur from late Cretaceous Mongolia with long, skinny legs. It moved about on two legs, was likely very nimble and could run at high speeds, something that would have been useful in the open desert plains where it lived. It had a small skull, and its teeth were small and pointed, suggesting that it ate insects and small animals, such as lizards and mammals. Its large eyes might have allowed Mononykus to hunt by night, when it was cooler and there would have been fewer predators about. Mononykus was originally named Mononychus in 1993, but later that year, it was renamed because the original name had already been used for a beetle named by Johann Schueppel, a German entomologist. </p>
