         <h1 id = "title"> <b> Dinos and Droids </b> </h1>
         <p> If you've been hoping to find out my top five list of the best robots and dinosaurs, look no further! I've been passionate about both since I was a kid. It all started with reading Zoobooks Dinosaurs and watching Star Trek with my dad. As an amateur paleontologist and artifical intelligence enthusiast, I can confidently say I have the expertise to make these very official and factual rankings. Read on to find out, or click the clinks to skip ahead if you want to be a cheater.</p>

				 <h2>Dot Matrix</h2>
				 <h6> [Spaceballs] </h6>
				 <img src="https://i.gifer.com/IlV6.gif" alt="Dot Matrix" width="500" height="300">
				 <p> Watching Spaceballs is one of my earliest memories. Released the year I was born, my dad was a big Mel Brooks fan and didn't hesitate to share that with me. A spoof of Star Wars, Dot Matrix takes the place of C-3PO in the gang. As a huge fan of comedy, I loved hearing Joan Rivers' abrasive voice and perfect delivery. She's a loyal friend of Princess Vespa, and anyone who hangs out with her can't be bad. She's part of the inspiration behind my love of comedy.</p>

				 <p> Prehistoric Planet was released on Apple+ and let me tell you, it's worth the hassle of setting up a free trial. Can you believe this face? They're one of my favorite theropods and archaeologists have made great developments regarding how they looked. Commonly mistaken by paleonormative folks as a barn owl, everyone wants to squish their wholesome little faces. I watched the five episodes as they were released daily and then binge watched all of them again on the last day of my free trial. It was almost worth starting the subscription, which is big because there's nothing else worth the money on the platform. I digress, Monny deserves all the attention here. She brings joy to all. </p>

				 <h2>Bender</h2>
				 <h6> [Futurama] </h6>
				 <img src="https://c.tenor.com/z34okGD0ZMoAAAAC/futurama-bender.gif" alt="Bender" width="400" height="250">
				 <p> Let me tell you, I've spent more hours watching and quoting Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez in my life than any other show or character. He is described as an "alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler", so he knows how to party. He loves to cook, even if he's terrible at it. He even played a set with Beck while injured. He's been broken apart, shocked, had his antenna clipped, and turned into a human only to slide to a gluttonous death. He has a ton of confidence and he knows how to use his shiny metal ass, especially when telling people to bite it. </p>

				 <h2>Cera</h2>
				 <h6> [The Land Before Time] </h6>
				 <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/11CWjXAb1JmpbO/giphy.gif" alt="Cera" width="350" height="250">
				 <p> One of my favorite dinosaur movies of all time features Cera, an orange female Triceratops or "three horn". She is separated from her parents and sisters during an earthquake before finding a motley crew of misfit friends. Independent, resilient, and a little stubborn, Cera seemed to me like such a strong and funny character. Sure, she made some terrible decisions that almost led to everyone's death and comes off a little selfish sometimes. But she has a huge heart and grows out of it a little once she starts to trust her friends. She loves to have fun, especially if she's challenged or feeling competitive. Plus, we just so happen to have the same(ish) name. She's destined to be a tattoo someday soon. </p>

				 <h2>Marvin the Paranoid Android</h2>
				 <h6> [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] </h6>
				 <img src="https://c.tenor.com/99N0G9NRwlYAAAAC/hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-life.gif" alt="Cera" width="450" height="200">
				 <p> Oh Marvin, my favorite character of all time. Sidekick in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, he always stole the show for me. He helps run the Heart of Gold, which no one else seems to know exactly how to do. He has a brain the size of a planet so he gets bored easily. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human (or 30 billion times more intelligent than a live mattress), though this is, if anything, an underestimation. Spoiler alert: he ends up saving everyone with his extreme depression and lethargy, shot through an emotion transferring gun. He's famous for quotes like, "Life! Don't talk to me about life.", "I have a million ideas. They all point to certain death.", and "My capacity for happiness, you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first". He's the straight man in the comedy structure, something I've never been able to achieve. Even though he gets low, his friends always keep him involved and help him out. He's already a tattoo, so he's stuck with me forever. </p>
